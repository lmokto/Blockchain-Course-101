Here, we try to do the actual mining <br>
We use a proof-of-work mechanism <br>
It works by taking a block and hashing it :-
<ol>
    <li> We use the SHA256 algorithm</li>
    <li> We need to get the hash as a string</li>
    <li> We check if this hash string has 4 zeros in the beginning</li>
    <li> if conditions are met, it is a valid block</li>
    <li> if not, we increment the nonce and try again, till infinity and beyond!</li>
</ol>
