Here, we will learn how to load the blocks <br />
And use whatever functions from simple blocks
<br />
Couple of salient points here (that you should think about) :- <br />
<ol>
    <li>Why are we passing cls? Wouldn't it make sense to just pass SimpleBlock</li>
    <li>How do we check if a node is valid?</li>
    <li>How are our nodes collected?</li>
</ol>
