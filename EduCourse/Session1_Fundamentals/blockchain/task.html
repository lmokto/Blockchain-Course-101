Here we build a blockchain with all the building-blocks we have made<br>
The blockchain is basically a list with some helper functions to make it easier to access it<br>
We only load blocks whose hashes make sense, otherwise we would be loading  abunch of garbage too <br>
We should have more checks here, but its a perfect place to start!
<br>
<br>

I would strongly suggest you to play around with this class
<ol>
    <li>explore your chaindata folder</li>
    <li>Delete some blocks and see what happens</li>
    <li>Can we use this class to make the first block?</li>
    <li>Go back to task 3 --> broadcasting and see what happens in your browser!</li>
</ol>,
