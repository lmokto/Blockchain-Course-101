Let's see how a simple block looks - pythonically<br />
A block usually consists of the following :- <br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Some data</b> : In bitcoin, this is a message you can write along with your transaction <br />
        For example : "Home rent" , "Pizza"
    </li>
    <li>
        <b> Hash of the previous block</b> This is very important. This is what connects the blocks and says which
        one is after which one. <i>The only exception is the genesis block, i.e the first block</i>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>TimeStamp</b> This allows you to decide which block was mined earlier. If two blocks were mined together,
        the one that was mined earlier is accepted
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Other Data</b> Which include the index, nonce, and other stuff. We will come back to this later
    </li>
</ul>
